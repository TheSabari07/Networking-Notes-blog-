# Networking Notes

## 1. Introduction to Networking
Networking is the practice of connecting computers and devices to share resources, data, and communication. It enables seamless interaction between systems, both locally and globally.

---

## 2. Types of Networks

Networks can be categorized based on different criteria, such as geographical area and connectivity.

---

### 2.1 Based on Geographical Area

| **Type** | **Description** | **Example** |
|----------|---------------|------------|
| **PAN (Personal Area Network)** | Small network for personal devices. | Bluetooth connection between phone and laptop. |
| **LAN (Local Area Network)** | Covers a small area like a home or office. | Wi-Fi network in a house. |
| **MAN (Metropolitan Area Network)** | Covers a city or large campus. | Cable TV network in a city. |
| **WAN (Wide Area Network)** | Covers large geographical areas. | The Internet. |

---

### 2.2 Based on Connectivity

| **Type** | **Description** |
|----------|---------------|
| **Wired Networks** | Uses physical cables for communication (Ethernet, Fiber optic). |
| **Wireless Networks** | Uses radio waves for communication (Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Cellular). |
| **Hybrid Networks** | Combination of both wired and wireless technologies. |

## 3. Networking Components

Networking consists of hardware and software components that enable communication between devices.

---

### 3.1 Hardware Components

#### 1. **Router**
📦 Connects different networks (e.g., Home network to the Internet).
📦 Directs data packets between networks.

#### 2. **Switch**
📦 Connects multiple devices within a LAN.
📦 Forwards data to the correct device based on MAC addresses.

#### 3. **Hub**
📦 Basic device that transmits data to all connected devices.
📦 Less efficient than a switch.

#### 4. **Modem**
📦 Converts digital signals to analog (for transmission over telephone lines) and vice versa.
📦 Used for Internet connectivity.

#### 5. **Access Point (AP)**
📦 Extends wireless network coverage.
📦 Common in large buildings for Wi-Fi.

#### 6. **Network Interface Card (NIC)**
📦 Hardware component in a device that allows network communication.
📦 Can be wired or wireless.

---

### 3.2 Software Components

#### 1. **Protocols**
📦 Set of rules for communication between devices.
📦 Examples: HTTP, TCP/IP, FTP, DNS, DHCP.

#### 2. **Operating System (OS)**
📦 Manages network connections and services.
📦 Examples: Windows, Linux, macOS, Cisco IOS.

#### 3. **Firewalls**
📦 Security system that monitors and controls network traffic.
📦 Protects against cyber threats.

## 4. Network Topologies

### 4.1 **Types of Network Topologies**

| **Topology** | **Description** | **Diagram** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Bus** | All devices connected to a single cable. | ──●──●──●── |
| **Star** | All devices connected to a central hub/switch. | ●─●─● (center) |
| **Ring** | Devices connected in a circular loop. | ●──●──●──●──● |
| **Mesh** | Every device is connected to every other device. | (Multiple connections) |
| **Hybrid** | Combination of two or more topologies. | Varies |

---
#### **Star Topology**
In a star topology, all devices are connected to a central hub or switch. The hub acts as the main point of communication, relaying data between devices.

**Advantages:**
✔ Easy to set up and expand.
✔ Fault isolation (one device failure does not affect others).
✔ High performance (no data collisions due to central control).

**Disadvantages:**
✘ Central point of failure (if the hub fails, the network stops working).
✘ Higher cost due to additional cables and hardware.

---

#### **Bus Topology**
In a bus topology, all devices are connected to a single backbone cable. Data travels in both directions along the cable.

**Advantages:**
✔ Cost-effective (requires less cable than other topologies).
✔ Easy to expand (new devices can be added easily).

**Disadvantages:**
✘ Limited cable length (performance degrades over long distances).
✘ Difficult troubleshooting (a single cable failure affects the entire network).

---

#### **Ring Topology**
In a ring topology, devices are connected in a circular manner, and data travels in one direction or both.

**Advantages:**
✔ Reduced data collisions (since data travels in a single direction).
✔ Equal access to resources (every device gets a fair chance to communicate).

**Disadvantages:**
✘ Failure in one device or connection can break the entire network.
✘ Adding or removing devices disrupts the network.

## 5. IP Addressing

### 5.1 **Types of IP Addresses**

| **Type** | **Description** |
|----------|---------------|
| **IPv4** | 32-bit address (e.g., 192.168.1.1) |
| **IPv6** | 128-bit address (e.g., 2001:db8::1) |
| **Public IP** | Used on the Internet, assigned by ISPs. |
| **Private IP** | Used within a local network. |

## 6. Conclusion
Networking is the backbone of modern communication, enabling devices to share information efficiently. Understanding network types, components, and configurations is crucial for building reliable and secure networks.
