# Introduction to Networking

## What is Networking?

Networking is the process of connecting computers and other devices to share information and resources. It allows communication between devices using different technologies like wired and wireless connections.

### **Explanation of the Basic Network Diagram**  

The diagram represents a **simple office or home network**, showing how different devices connect to communicate and access the internet. Here’s how it works:  

1. **Internet** → The network starts with an internet connection from an Internet Service Provider (ISP).  
2. **Router** → The router connects to the internet and acts as the central hub of the network. It manages traffic between devices and can connect to both wired and wireless devices.  
3. **PC 1** → This computer is directly connected to the router, either through Wi-Fi or an Ethernet cable.  
4. **Switch** → A switch is used when multiple devices need to be connected via a wired network. It expands the number of available ports beyond what the router provides.  
5. **PC 2, PC 3, and Printer** → These devices connect to the switch, allowing them to communicate with each other and access shared resources like the printer.  

### **Key Points:**  
- **The router connects the internal network to the internet.**  
- **The switch helps connect multiple wired devices.**  
- **Devices in the network can communicate, share files, and access the internet.**  
- **A printer can be shared among multiple users in the network.**  

This setup is commonly used in **homes, small offices, and businesses** to efficiently manage internet and resource sharing.

## When and Who Created Networking?
The concept of networking began in the 1960s with the creation of ARPANET (Advanced Research Projects Agency Network), developed by the United States Department of Defense. This network laid the foundation for the modern internet by enabling communication between computers at different locations.

### Example and Diagram

## Key Takeaways
- Networking connects devices to share data and resources.
- It can be wired (Ethernet) or wireless (Wi-Fi, Bluetooth).
- ARPANET was the first network, leading to the internet.
- Understanding networking is crucial for cybersecurity and IT.

## Why is Networking Important for Cybersecurity?
Networking plays a crucial role in cybersecurity because:
- **Understanding Threats:** Hackers exploit network vulnerabilities.
- **Secure Configuration:** Properly configured networks reduce risks.
- **Traffic Monitoring:** Analyzing network traffic helps detect cyberattacks.
- **Firewalls & IDS/IPS:** Security devices rely on networking knowledge.

# ARPANET: The First Internet

## What is ARPANET?
ARPANET (Advanced Research Projects Agency Network) was the **first computer network** that allowed multiple computers to communicate over long distances. It was created in **1969** by the **U.S. Department of Defense** to connect research institutions and share information efficiently.


# Why Did ARPANET Shut Down?  

ARPANET was shut down on **February 28, 1990**, due to the following reasons:  

## 1. The Internet Took Over  
- ARPANET helped develop **TCP/IP**, which became the foundation of the modern **internet**.  
- By the late 1980s, **newer and faster networks** like NSFNET replaced ARPANET.  

## 2. Security Issues  
- ARPANET was **not designed for security** and had **no strong encryption**.  
- As cyber threats increased, a **more secure network** was needed.  

## 3. Commercial Networks Grew  
- **Private companies and institutions** started using **faster commercial networks**.  
- ARPANET was no longer the main network for research and communication.  

## 4. Government Shut It Down  
- The **U.S. Department of Defense** decided to **phase out ARPANET** as it was outdated.  
- Resources were redirected to **modern networking projects**.  

## ARPANET’s Legacy  
- It was the **first step toward the internet** we use today.  
- **Packet switching technology** became the standard for all networks.  
- It paved the way for **modern cybersecurity and networking**.
